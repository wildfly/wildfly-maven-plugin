== Releasing

Releasing the project requires permission to deploy to Maven Central see https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/[Maven Central Release Requirements].
Once everything is setup, you simply need to run the `./release.sh` script. There are two required parameters:

1. `-r` or `--release` which is the version you want to release
2. `-d` or `--development` which is the next development version.

By default, the release version cannot contain `SNAPSHOT` and the development version, must contain `SNAPSHOT`.
